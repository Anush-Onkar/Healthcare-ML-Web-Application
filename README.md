# Healthcare-ML-Application-End-to-End-with-Deployment

Access to quality healthcare and doctors has always been a concern in developing countries and remote areas. To deal with such issues, this healthcare web application is developed. Healthcare data was fed to machine learning training models and engines for predictive modelling. The accuracy of these models is directly proportional to the training they get. These models will be able to predict the potential health risks to a patient a lot earlier so that they could take the preventive measures and live a long healthy life.
